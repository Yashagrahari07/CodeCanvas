## üöÄ Overview

CodeAlong is a dynamic and interactive code editor application which leverages the Monaco Editor for React to provide a robust coding environment where users can create and manage folders and files seamlessly.
Built with WebSocket API, this feature allows two or more users to engage in real-time coding. They can share the same editor space and see each other's changes instantly.
This project is designed to facilitate collaborative coding, making it an ideal tool for pair programming, coding interviews, and team-based coding projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Backend API

1. **Clone the repository**

    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/Shuchita33/CodeAlong)
    cd your-repo/server
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the necessary environment variables if you want to run the server at your local host.
   Otherwise no need for this.
   
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
    BASE_URL=your_localhost_url
    ```
   If you are locally running the server, follow these changes in `client` directory.
   1. Open socket.js file in client/src folder.
   Make the change
   ```sh
     return io([your_localhost_url], options)
   ```
   3. Move to client/src/api/api.js file and replace the baseURL as well.
      
    
5. **Start the backend server**
    ```sh
   npm start
    ```
### Frontend App

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
    ```sh
    cd ../client
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**
